# OpenGL-Elastic-Collision-Simulator

I had been studying academically for a long time and was feeling burned out due to the pressure that comes with it.  
So I decided to disconnect by building a project in something I hadn’t studied academically — relying only on brain power, my previous knowledge, and my experience in computer science.

I made this project after watching only about 40 minutes of Victor Gordon's OpenGL Crash Course on FreeCodeCamp, and reading some basics about the physics behind elastic simulation,  
Equal-sized circles collide with each other and change color based on which one is faster — the faster one gives its color to the slower one, as shown in the GIF below.

Despite not having experience in computer graphics, I made sure to apply clean code principles, which helped me alot in the debugging even though I hadn’t worked in this domain before, it was smooth thanks to clean code.
